# Creating a Docker Image for Your Application üê≥

All the code that I have, I need to copy to my Docker container and run my app. **Is there any way?**

Yes! We can create our own Docker image.

## Understanding How We Usually Run an App

Before creating an image, let's understand how we usually run our app:

1. **You will need some OS.**
2. **You need software like Python, Node.js, Java, etc.**
3. **You need related dependencies.**
4. **You need your code.**
5. **Build the code.**
6. **Start the app.**

These are the steps we usually follow.

## Translating Steps into Docker

Now, I want all these steps to be executed and run using Docker. For that, I need to write a **Dockerfile**.

Let's try one by one.

### Dockerfile Instructions

For taking step by step in a Dockerfile, we have something called **instructions**. We will be using these instructions to build the Docker image.

### Step 1: Specify the Base OS

**How can I take my OS?**

We have the `FROM` instruction.

I need Debian OS, so I'll specify:

```dockerfile
FROM debian:latest
```
### Step 2: Install Required Software

Now, I need Python to be installed.

**How do I install Python?**

I can use the `RUN` instruction and provide the Linux commands.
```
# Install Python
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
```

- `apt-get update`: Updates the package lists.
- `apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip`: Installs Python 3 and pip without prompting for confirmation (`-y`).

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Assuming my application has a `requirements.txt` file for Python dependencies, I will copy it into the image and install the dependencies.
For copying we will use **`copy`** instruction, and for WORKING DIR we use **`WORKDIR`** Instruction.

```
# Copy requirements.txt
COPY requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Add Your Code

Next, I need to copy my application code into the image.
```
# Copy application code
COPY . /app
```
This copies all files from your current directory into the `/app` directory in the image.

### Step 5: Build the Code

If your application needs to be built or compiled, include the necessary commands. For Python applications, this step may not be necessary unless you have specific build steps.

### Step 6: Start the Application

Use the `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` instruction to specify the command that runs when the container starts.
```
# Start the application
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```

Replace `app.py` with the entry point of your application.

### Complete Example of the Dockerfile

Putting it all together, your Dockerfile might look like this:

```dockerfile
# Use Debian as the base image
FROM debian:latest

# Set environment variables to ensure no prompts during package installation
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Install Python
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application code
COPY . /app

# Expose the port your application runs on (optional)
EXPOSE 80

# Start the application
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```

Here if you Observe we are using **`EXPOSE`** instruction also, it helps to expose you app on specific port.

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image using the Dockerfile, run the following command in your terminal:
```
docker build -t my-app-image .
```

- `-t my-app-image`: Tags the image with the name `my-app-image`.
- `.`: Tells Docker to look for the Dockerfile in the current directory.

## Running the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run a container from it:
```
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name my-app-container my-app-image
```

- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `-p 80:80`: Maps port **80** in the container to port **80** on your host machine.
- `--name my-app-container`: Names the container `my-app-container`.
- `my-app-image`: The name of the image to create the container from.

## we are now able to create the Image, Lets create one more Image.

## [REACT_APP](https://github.com/dockersamples/blog-react-app/tree/main)

## Lets clone the repo and try to Build the Docker image

```
git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/blog-react-app.git
```

### Build docker Image

**`docker build -t reactapp .`**

Observe the `Dockerfile`

Now lets list the image, if you Observe the Image size is almost `1.4GB` which is really huge in docker environment. 

Lets take a close look at the Dockerfile. 

We are running nodejs as the backend server here. Since it requires downloading the node_modules the size here is very huge.

Can we Optimize the size?

Yes We can run the application with only necessary packages, and remove unnecessary packages, by this we will be able to minimize the Docker Image Size.
To get this done we have Multi layer Docker Image. Here we Initially take a base Image and build the application, once the application is built we then take another base image in same Dockerfile and copy the Build Output to the new Base Image and run it. By following this when the container runs, only the latest base Image will be running.

## Learning Instructions in Dockerfile

We have seen `COPY` Instruction which helps in copying the files while building the docker Image.

### üîπ `COPY`

#### üìù Purpose: 
üöõ `COPY` is the simpler and more straightforward command. It copies files or directories from your local file system into the Docker image.

#### What it can do:
- Copies files from the build context (`.`) to a specified location in the container.
- Only handles **local files** or **directories**.

#### ‚úÖ When to Use:
- When you need to **copy files exactly** as they are into the container.
- Best for most use cases where you are simply copying files or directories from your machine to the image.

```
COPY <source-path> <destination-path>
COPY . .     # copies all current dirctory file to the WORKDIR
COPY . /opt  # copies all current directory files to /opt folder
```
üîπ **ADD**

üìù **Syntax**:

**Purpose**: ‚ú® `ADD` does everything `COPY` does, but with a few extra capabilities.

**What it can do**:
- Copy local files or directories (just like `COPY`).
- Extract local `.tar` archives directly into the destination directory.
- Fetch files from remote URLs and add them to the container.

‚ö†Ô∏è **When to Use**:
- When you need to:
  - Extract tar files (e.g., `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`).
  - Download files from a remote URL into the image.

‚ö° **Example 1: Copy and Extract a `.tar` File**
```
ADD https://example.com/file.tar.gz /usr/src/app/
ADD my-archive.tar.gz /usr/src/app/
```

## üîë Best Practices

- **Use `COPY`** whenever possible for simplicity, transparency, and better maintainability. It‚Äôs more predictable and avoids unexpected behavior.
- **Use `ADD`** only when you need its extra functionality, like extracting a `.tar` file or downloading files from a remote URL.
