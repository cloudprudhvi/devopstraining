### Why Docker
Imagine you've developed an application that works flawlessly on your machine. When you share it with a colleague, they run into issues because their environment is differentâ€”different libraries, dependencies, or configurations. What if you could package your entire application, along with all its dependencies and settings, into a single unit that your colleague can run on their system without any compatibility problems? That's essentially what Docker allows you to do.
