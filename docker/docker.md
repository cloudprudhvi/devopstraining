### Why Docker
Imagine you've developed an application that works flawlessly on your machine. When you share it with a colleague, they run into issues because their environment is differentâ€”different libraries, dependencies, or configurations. What if you could package your entire application, along with all its dependencies and settings, into a single unit that your colleague can run on their system without any compatibility problems? That's essentially what Docker allows you to do.


## Virtual Machine Vs Containers

![Vm vs Container](../images/docker/vmvscontainer.png)

### What is Hypervisor
A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.




| Aspect              | Virtual Machines (VMs)                                   | Containers                                       |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Architecture**    | Includes the entire guest operating system               | Shares the host operating system's kernel        |
| **Resource Usage**  | Heavyweight; requires more memory and storage            | Lightweight; uses less memory and storage        |
| **Isolation**       | Full isolation with separate OS instances                | Isolated processes within the same OS            |
| **Performance**     | Slower startup and performance due to full OS            | Faster startup and performance                   |
| **Size**            | Larger size (usually in gigabytes)                       | Smaller size (often in megabytes)                |
| **Boot Time**       | Takes minutes to start                                   | Starts in seconds                                |
| **Portability**     | Less portable; depends on hypervisor and hardware        | Highly portable across different environments    |
| **Use Cases**       | Running multiple operating systems on one machine        | Deploying microservices and scalable apps        |
| **Management**      | More complex to set up and maintain                      | Easier to manage with tools like Docker          |
| **Security**        | Strong isolation provides better security                | Shares kernel; requires careful security measures |
